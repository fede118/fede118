- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fede118.
  Apart from programming, I like to read, watch movies/series, play sports, play the guitar and play videogames :D

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Android Development and continue learning more about programming in general

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced kotling features and implementing the things I learn in my [MovieKnight app](https://github.com/fede118/MovieKnight) (currently WIP) in my free time. It still needs a lot of work but I'm working on it ðŸ’ª

  Note: I really enjoy creating this app because it mixes 2 things I really like programming + movies :D

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: fede.cano118@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-cano-348505178/


- Note: this repository has really old code from when I first started programming! but is great because you can see my progress in a relatively short time
