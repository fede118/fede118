- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fede118.
  Apart from programming, I like to read, watch movies/series, play sports, play the guitar and play videogames :D

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently creating my Expense tracker app -> [ExpenseLens]([https://github.com/fede118/MyStockApp](https://github.com/fede118/ExpenseLens)):
  - It uses Img2Text to extract text from a picture of (hopefully :P) a receipt/bill
  - Then uses Gemini AI to process this text and extrect values: Date, Total, Category (more to come)
  - More details on the Repo :D

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: fede.cano118@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-cano-348505178/


- Note: this repository has really old code from when I first started programming! but is great because you can see my progress in a relatively short time
