- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fede118.
  Apart from programming, I like to read, watch movies/series, play sports, play the guitar and play videogames :D

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Jetpack Compose -> [MyStock app](https://github.com/fede118/MyStockApp) It still needs a lot of work but I'm working on it ðŸ’ª

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: fede.cano118@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-cano-348505178/


- Note: this repository has really old code from when I first started programming! but is great because you can see my progress in a relatively short time
